# Neural Networks From Scratch

(Work in progress)<br>
In this project I'll build a Neural Network from scrath (not in Scratch) <br>
This project is inspired by the youtuber sentdex who has a book on this topic, but I wanted to try to do it myself to better understand Neural Networks in general.
Everything will be in Python and maybe later I'll make a C++ version as well.
